HMDA project - Capital One

Written in Python3.5
by Ben Wilson

The entire program is contained within the python file entitled 'Main.py'

Command Line supported use is achieved with the following arguments:
    -i Input location of the zip file directory of the raw data
    -o Output location desired for saving json files and charts(if desired)
    -s State listing to restrict the json file production (optional, defaults to All States)
    -f Conventional_Conforming loan filter (defaults to False (no filtering))
    -p Plotting boolean (True = plot charts, False = no charting)

Example Usage at the command prompt:
    >python Main.py -i C:/Cap1_DC -o C:/Cap1_Output -s 'VA', 'WV', 'DE' -f True -p True

Output locations:
    - The JSON files will be produced within per-state folders located in subdirectories beneath the
    supplied output directory by the -o argument.  Each file will be located in these folders.
    - The overall Market share json data will be located in the Market_Share directory in the output
    directory folder.
    - Plots will be placed into 3 separate directories (County_Plots, Top_Lenders, and Total_Market).
        - County Plots will be organized by state and will produce a distribution plot of applicant income
        from within the county.
        - Top Lenders plot will show the top 10 lenders for the most recent year and their lending history
        within each state.
        - Total Market will show the number of issued loans by state over time (General trend)

Source file concerns:
    - For a production-ready application, a number of complex rules would need to be developed that would
    provide sanitized and standardized results from the Respondent_Name_TS, as well as a possible
    spell check verifier through a module such as PyEnchant (passing a tokenized list of all words
    in the Respondent_Name_TS field through a customized dictionary that has been curated for financial
    abbreviations and returning most likely match for each word, then updating the field - although this
    would involve creating a rather large dictionary which I did not have time to do).
    - For a true application of this data, one of the most useful aspects would be to acquire the results
    of all applications (i.e. was the application approved?  What standing is it in?), as well as information
    regarding demographics of the applicants apart from their income.  What is their credit score,
    how much debt do they have, and what is their history regarding payments?  With this information,
    a robust prediction algorithm could be developed that would assess the risk for a particular market,
    as well as being a feed-in to a decision algorithm for determining future potential clients in a region.
    - Reference tables should be established if, as the problem statement said, data changes over time
    from the agencies that report this data.  County_Code, Census_Tract_Number, MSA_MD, Respondent_ID, and
    State_Code should all be considered immutable and be referenced by internal curating, rather than
    relying on reporting agencies to 'get it right', in order to have accurate summary statistics that can
    be used to draw conclusions and decisions from.
